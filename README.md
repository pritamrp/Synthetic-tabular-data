BA890:  Analytics Practicum - Pritam Pandit

This project explores generating synthetic tabular data using CTGAN and REaLTabFormer models. The dataset used includes player behavior and demographics in online gaming. We compare the models' ability to produce high-quality, privacy-preserving synthetic data for practical applications.

Original Dataset : Predict Online Gaming Behaviour Dataset

Synthetic Data Generation Models : 
[1] SDV Developers. (2023). CTGAN: Conditional tabular GAN. Retrieved from https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN
[2] World Bank. (2023). REaLTabFormer: Realistic tabular data transformer. Retrieved from https://github.com/worldbank/REaLTabFormer

Conclusion : 
The REaLTabFormer model outperformed CTGAN in generating realistic synthetic tabular data, thanks to its ability to model complex relationships within the data.

Note : 
Due to computational constraints, The Transformer model has been run in seperate Jupyter notebook named.
